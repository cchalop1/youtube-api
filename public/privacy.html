        The GPT processes YouTube video transcripts to generate summaries.

        No user data, video history, or metadata is collected, stored, or
        shared.
      </li>
      <li>All processing occurs in real-time without data retention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Open-Source Commitment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The codebase is fully open-source, allowing users to verify our privacy
        practices.

        We do not process or store any sensitive or personally identifiable
        information.

        The tool operates in a stateless manner, ensuring no persistent data is
        retained.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      As an open-source project, updates may be made to improve functionality,
      but privacy principles will remain unchanged. Any modifications will be
      transparent and documented in the repository.
